LEGAL
The Chinese government’s system of colonial boarding schools in Tibet and the physical and psychological abuse, restriction on the use of their mother tongue, and aggressive cultural erasure that Tibetan children suffer within them implicate both Chinese domestic law and various treaties and customs under international law.

For example, China’s domestic law contains explicit protections of Tibetan language rights, specifically in the context of education. China’s constitution states that “[a]ll nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages and to preserve or reform their own folkways and customs.” The 1984 "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" (Article 37) further provides that “[s]chools (classes) and other educational organizations recruiting mostly ethnic minority students should, whenever possible, use textbooks in their own languages and use these languages as the media of instruction” (emphasis added). The law further instructs that minority schools should teach Chinese language classes starting in late primary or in secondary school and does not direct that any Chinese language be taught in kindergarten, nor that Chinese be the language of instruction at any point during primary or secondary education. The law was amended in 2001 to provide that minority schools should start teaching Chinese language in “junior or senior grades” of primary school.” In addition, China’s Law on the Protection of Minors provides that “[t]eaching and administrative staff in schools and kindergartens shall respect the personal dignity of minors, and shall not subject them to corporal punishment or corporal punishment in disguised form, or commit any other act that humiliates the personal dignity of minors.”

With regard to international law, various UN bodies have now pointed out the multiple ways in which China’s colonial boarding school system – and its aggressive cultural assimilation, elimination of Tibetan as the medium of instruction, coerced family separation, and closure of private schools - conflicts with its obligations under a list of treaties. As the UN Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Special Rapporteur on the right to education, and Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief pointed out in their November 2022 communication to the government of China, China’s policies toward Tibetan children implicate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 1; the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), articles 5, 28, 29, and 30; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), articles 13 and 15; the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, article 5; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 18; the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, articles 2, 4, and 5; and the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, article 5, as well as various other relevant human rights documents, recommendations, and handbooks. The Special Rapporteurs noted that “the residential schools system for Tibetan children appears to act as a large-scale program to assimilate Tibetans into majority Han culture, contrary to the international human rights standards.”
In March 2023, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights echoed the Special Rapporteurs’ concern that the colonial boarding schools violate China’s obligations under the ICESCR, and urged the Chinese government to “abolish immediately the coerced residential (boarding) school system imposed on Tibetan children.” In May 2023, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), noted its concern that the colonial boarding school system conflicts with the covenant’s article 36; it, too, urged China to “[a]bolish the coerced residential (boarding) school system imposed on Tibetan girls and authorize the establishment of and subsidize private Tibetan schools.”
