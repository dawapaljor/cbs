Despite the extreme repression under which Tibetans are living, they continue to resist, speaking out near constantly to protect their language, Buddhist traditions, culture, and identity. For years, Tibetans have found ways to work around the system, adapting Tibetan-run schools so that they were not closed down providing language, religion, or history classes during vacations. Today, the Chinese government has eliminated almost all of these spaces. Nonetheless, people are still sharing their views and ideas online, questioning and challenging policies in public and private, determined to overcome the current circumstances.

International attention and advocacy has brought global awareness to China’s boarding school system in Tibet and the colonial policies they are enacting. State propaganda has had the unintended side effect of communicating to Tibetans in Tibet that these policies are being noticed and opposed. This gives much needed hope to Tibetans fighting for their rights. 

In countries like Canada, the United States, and Australia, colonial attempts to eliminate Indigenous identities through boarding school and other forced separations failed, but resulted in unspeakable damage to Indigenous people and nations’ societies, cultures, languages. This harm continues to reverberate through generations. So too will Chinese government efforts to obliterate Tibetan identity fail, but much damage is already being done on both personal and societal levels.

Education in Tibet was not always so grim. Less than a decade ago, Tibetan academics, parents, and teachers gathered to discuss and agree on a detailed vision for Tibetan-centric preschool education. For years before, professors and teachers were developing rich new resources for Tibetan-language education that was culturally relevant and appropriate for the diversity of people and backgrounds within Tibet.

This potential is still there and will flourish again once Xi Jinping’s cynical attempt to win a war through Tibetan children fails. Tibetan-run schools, including monastery schools, must re-open. Monks and nuns should return to their monasteries or nunneries. Preschoolers should have an option to attend, but not be required to do so. All elementary school children should be able to live at home if they and their parents wish, with options such as distance learning or transportation to and from school developed. Tibetans must be in control of their own education with parents able to make free and informed choices without fear or coercion. There is much the international community can and must do to support Tibetans, as outlined below.
