China’s education policies in Tibet seek to deracinate Tibetan children from their culture, language, and identity. In the colonial boarding school system, children are first separated from their families, and then bombarded with pro-CCP ideas, images, texts, and songs, all in Chinese language. A Tibetan who recently escaped from Tibet described: 

<QuotePrimary>
    In boarding schools, the indoctrination process begins from a very young age. The children are taken away from their parents, restricted from speaking their mother tongue, Tibetan, taught in Chinese language, forced to learn and speak Chinese, and taught only state approved history.  
</QuotePrimary>
Students are exposed to persistent messages at school about the centrality of Chinese identity, history, and culture and the importance of the CCP. A former boarding school student described how this politicized education was implemented in her classroom:

<QuotePrimary>
…All the materials put on our class walls were in Chinese. All [my] class teachers [were] Chinese....In all the classes, we have pictures of Xi Jinping, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. Xi Jinping Thought was taught in classes; it was part of our school curriculum. We get a better score if we write in appreciation of Xi Jinping, his leadership and China. Essays and drawings are judged based on how much we are able to praise the party, the state and the army.
</QuotePrimary>

All students in China are subjected to a politicized curriculum that is intended to consolidate loyalty to Xi Jinping and the Communist Party. However, in Tibet, education is part of a larger effort to explicitly demobilize a sense of Tibetanness and change students’ primary identification to be Chinese, rather than Tibetan. At best, being Tibetan is a sub-category of being Chinese, with a “sense of community of the Chinese nation” being paramount.

In addition to inundating Tibetan children with propaganda, the boarding schools engage in aggressive linguistic and cultural erasure. Children whose mother tongue is Tibetan must undergo schooling almost entirely in Chinese, including preschoolers. Tibetan imagery is removed from the classroom walls and Tibetan history and culture stripped from the curriculum, so that children only encounter Chinese identity and culture. One person described how in preschools, “whether it’s drawing, games, or other activities, everything is taught in Chinese – Tibetan games are not allowed.” 

A Tibetan who recently escaped from Tibet to India described: 

<QuotePrimary>
In…preschools, the teachers communicate with children in Chinese, they teach children to sing political songs in praise of the communist heroes like Mao or CCP and New China. Although there is a Tibetan class, it is very poor. Most of these children speak only in Chinese, there are very few children who speak in Tibetan. 

I feel the Chinese government aims to wipe out our language, traditions and letters…When we were in school, the Tibetan language and Tibetan history were taught. But now all the textbooks have changed, it's completely different. Children cannot study Tibetan and Tibetan history. They are taught Chinese language and the history of China written by Chinese writers.
</QuotePrimary>

Others described how the Tibetan language is eliminated from every aspect of boarding preschool. One person noted that all words at the school they knew – even songs, native place names and admission notices – are Chinese.

Since the colonial boarding system in Tibet was exposed, the Chinese government has released extensive propaganda arguing that Tibetan students receive a “bilingual” education in boarding schools and that the schools teach Tibetan children to value their Tibetan culture and heritage. However, “bilingual” in China appears to mean heavy use of Chinese, rather than Tibetan. In state media pieces, Tibetans can be seen affirming these claims. But online, Tibetans in Tibet express their concern – even despair – about schools one after another changing to a Chinese-medium curriculum and the serious risk that Tibetan children will not be able to speak their own language within a generation. 

Colonial boarding school students now living in exile describe a Chinese immersion education, with at best, a short language class in their mother tongue. A former student from Lhasa described her experience:

<QuotePrimary>
There is one Tibetan class per day for 45 minutes, but the teacher can change it at any time and have the entire class work on a different subject instead, like math. This happens about twice per week. Even the Tibetan teacher uses Mandarin words during Tibetan class. 

Every minute of the day other than Tibetan language class is spent speaking Mandarin.
</QuotePrimary>
Another former student described how all her classes – Chinese, Math, Tibetan, Science, Art, Physical Education, Dance, and Music – were taught in Chinese, except for the Tibetan class. In addition, during a daily break students were required to sing the [Chinese] national anthem, as well as “songs praising the Chinese Communist Party, the State and the PLA – like love the Party, love the country and love the army” and that school authorities “encouraged us to speak…Chinese.” 

Another student explained:
<QuotePrimary>
Most of the teachers at my school are Chinese. There are very few Tibetan teachers and they only teach Tibetan. Except for Tibetan class, everything is taught in Chinese.
</QuotePrimary>

In addition to falsely claiming that Tibetan language and culture are featured at boarding school, Chinese authorities also state that Chinese-medium teaching starting very young is simply an effective method of ensuring Tibetans are fluent to enhance their employment prospects in China. However, this directly contradicts decades of research showing that mother tongue-based education, particularly in early learning and elementary school, is the best way for children to succeed throughout their school years. Six to eight years of mother-tongue based education, followed by a gradual transition to the second language and continued opportunities in the first language, is the recipe for true bilingualism. This is the case even in environments where a second language will be required, as described by an expert in the field: “Bilingual children perform better in school when the school effectively teaches the mother tongue…By contrast, when children’s mother tongue is encouraged to atrophy and its development stagnates, children’s personal and conceptual foundation for learning is undermined.” 

Researchers warn that children rapidly lose their first language Research indicates that receiving instruction in a child’s first language throughout primary school and then gradually transitioning to a second language, with continued development of their first language, allows them to be bilingual. “If, however, children are forced to switch abruptly or transition too soon from learning in their mother tongue to schooling in a second language, their first language acquisition may be attenuated or even lost. Even more importantly, their self-confidence as learners and their interest in what they are learning may decline, leading to lack of motivation, school failure, and early school leaving.


As this literature review underscores, children’s first language skills can be un
dermined or lost if they are not supported  through  formal  instruction  and/or  practice  with  highly  profi  cient  and  literate  speakers  of  the 
language. If a child’s mother tongue is not maintained and developed over time, he or she may someday be unable to use the language and, indeed, may have no
memory of ever having known it (Pallier, Dehaene,
Poline, LeBihan, Argenti, Dupopux, et al., 2003). 

However, educators are often much less aware about how quickly children can lose their ability to use their mother tongues, even in the home context. The extent and rapidity of language loss will vary according to the concentration of families from a particular linguistic group in the school and neighborhood. Where the mother tongue is used extensively in the community outside the school, then language loss among young children will be less. However, where language communities are not concentrated or ‘ghettoized‘ in particular neighborhoods, children can lose their ability to communicate in their mother tongue within 2-3 years of starting school. They may retain receptive (understanding) skills in the language but they will use the majority language in speaking with their peers and siblings and in responding to their parents. By the time children become adolescents, the linguistic gap between parents and children has become an emotional chasm. Pupils frequently become alienated from the cultures of both home and school with predictable results. 

Beyond the negative consequences for school achievement and learning, education in a foreign language and loss of the mother tongue has profound social, emotional, and cultural impacts. Children risk failing “to become linguistically competent members of their families and communities and lose the ability to connect with their cultural heritage,” only able to talk about minor things with their parents and grandparents. As 
this literature review underscores, children’s fi
rst language skills can be un
dermined or lost if they are not

language. If a child’s mother tongue is not maintained and developed over time, he or she may someday be

Poline, LeBihan, Argenti, Dupopux, et al., 2003).


If Chinese language proficiency were truly the goal of the Chinese government, authorities would cease closures of successful Tibetan schools that include strong Chinese language programs and would develop a genuinely bilingual schooling system that fosters strength in both languages.

Other former students agreed, saying that being separated from family and not being able to go home was the most difficult aspect of colonial boarding school. One said, “Sometimes, I felt like a prisoner in the school.” 

At its worst, forced attendance at colonial boarding school has resulted in children taking their own lives. For example, earlier this year, RFA reported that a 17-year-old monk who had been made to attend colonial boarding school had committed suicide. Their sources described how the boy, Longyang, was removed from his monastery at age 14. Not allowed to return to the monastery even during school breaks, Longyang would periodically become depressed, stop eating, become ill, and be sent home to his family. Although initially authorities allowed him and other young monks to wear their monks’ robes at school on certain occasions, and not to be present at school at all times, restrictions tightened in early 2024, when Longyang and others were told they had to disrobe and stay permanently at school. One of the sources said, “He had said that if he would be permanently stripped of his robes and required to go to school in his plainclothes, then he would kill himself.” He again became depressed and, when sent home, took his own life.


## Emotional Distance from Family
Separation from family and community is not limited to physical distance. Tibetans describe how their children, immersed in Chinese language and culture and barred from their own mother tongue, lose their ability to communicate with their families. While the loss of language alone is something that will impact a child’s life forever, being unable to communicate with family members, especially grandparents, means children are also cut off from the transfer of knowledge, history, and culture between generations. One Tibetan explains:
