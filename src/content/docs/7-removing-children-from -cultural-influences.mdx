In 2015, the State Council “Decision on Accelerating the Development of Ethnic Education” emphasized the “goal that students of all ethnic minorities will study in a school, live in a school, and grow up in a school” in order to realize, among other things, the “long term stability of the country.” Today this is being achieved through interlinked enforcement actions including closing local village schools, shutting down privately-run Tibetan schools, forcing young monks and nuns, traditionally educated within monasteries or nunneries, to enroll in state boarding schools. Together, these actions result in children being removed from their homes and communities and into state institutions. In addition, the government seeks to control what children are exposed to even outside of school by forbidding children from attending supplementary Tibetan language classes or engaging in religious activities during school breaks.

In the past 15 years, Chinese authorities have closed hundreds or even thousands of local schools in Tibet, while building and expanding boarding schools. This “school consolidation” took place across China starting in the early 2000s, but was halted in China proper because of popular discontent. However, in non-Han areas, the policy continued in full force, shuttering more and more schools.

Compounding the lack of alternatives to state boarding schools, the government has also forced the closure of Tibetan-run private schools across the plateau. Notably, the Chinese government is rapidly shutting down Tibetan schools even as they cite lack of schooling facilities as a justification for the boarding school system. 

Parents want their children to be educated, and China has a national requirement for nine years of primary and secondary education (referred to as “compulsory education”). But because local and Tibetan-run schooling options have been deliberately eliminated by the state, the remaining option is state-run boarding school. This means that parents must send their children away at a young age to spend the majority of their childhood in state institutions. As one person explained:

<QuotePrimary>
With a policy of compulsory education, all the children must complete their nine years of education. There are no schools in the township [in my area], therefore parents have to send their children to a county boarding school.
</QuotePrimary>

The compulsory education law, among others, has also been used to force young monks and nuns out of monasteries or nunneries and into state boarding schools. One person explained:

<QuotePrimary>
Because of the compulsory education policies, the young children cannot become monks now. Earlier most families send at least one of their children to become monk or nun but now they cannot do it. The young children are forced to go to [state-run] school. Parents are threatened, beaten and sued for not sending their children to school. If the parents are old, the other family members are threatened.
</QuotePrimary>

A parent from another area described how their child had always wanted to be a monk, and as a teenager, they sent him to the local monastery. However, the family was then visited multiple times by local officials, who warned them that their son couldn’t go to the monastery any more. They explained:

<QuotePrimary>
My son’s dream was to go to the monastery, and it was the only way for him to learn our language and culture. But a local official insisted that we instead send him to a government boarding school where it is impossible to learn Tibetan language. They told us they would cut off government payments and government-issued identification cards necessary for other essential documents if we kept sending him to the monastery.
</QuotePrimary>

Monastery schools have also been closed by authorities, and authorities have then compelled parents to enroll their children in state boarding schools. For example, from May - October 2024, Chinese authorities forced the closure of at least three schools at prominent monasteries in eastern Tibet’s Ngaba region (known in Chinese as Aba in Sichuan province). At least 1,500 monastic students between the ages of 6 and 18 from Muge, Kirti and Taktsang Kirti Monasteries were forced to leave and, in most cases, enroll in government-run residential elementary, middle and vocational schools. By forcing young monks and nuns into state-run schools, China effectively weakens the role and influence of monastic institutions, traditionally the heart of Tibetan learning, culture, and national identity.

“The Best Hope Now is the Parents” – Vacation Classes and Religious Activities Banned
</QuotePrimary>

The policies described above largely ensure that Tibetan children grow up under the influence of the Party rather than that of their family. However, the Party has extended its reach even further: instituting a ban on attending Tibetan language classes or engaging in religious activities outside of school, while on holiday. Parents have also been warned to keep their children away from religion in general. In this way, the Party seeks to prevent parents from providing some of the language or cultural context children are prevented from accessing at colonial boarding school, effectively closing off all avenues for its transmission.

For the past several years, space for Tibetans to hold supplementary classes for children during school vacation has been gradually eliminated. Instructors have sometimes been jailed and both teachers and parents have spoken about being forced to sign letters stating the children will not attend holiday classes or monastery school.

RFA reports how, after several years of restrictions on monasteries and individuals offering language, religion, and other classes during school holidays, a wide-reaching notice from the Chinese Department of Education in January 2024 reportedly stated that Tibetan children can participate only in supplementary classes and workshops taught by state-authorized individuals and organizations and on state-approved subjects. The same notice reportedly ordered local authorities to intensify their restrictions on supplementary classes, and reiterated a ban on children participating in religious activities.

This ban was then enforced through draconian measures, with authorities going door to door in residential areas and commercial establishments at various times of day and night to ensure no children were studying Tibetan language or participating in Buddhist activities. These extreme measures took place across Tibet, including in Lhasa (U-Tsang or TAR), Labrang Monastery in Amdo (Chinese: Xiahe, Gansu) and Yushul prefecture in Kham (Chinese: Yushu, Qinghai). 

Tibetan sources for this report expressed distress about the measures to restrict children’s access to classes and described how, little by little, all options for a Tibetan education are being closed off:

<QuotePrimary>
To study Tibetan grammar, history or culture, we have to go to classes organized by our local monasteries during school holidays. But for the last 5-6 years, these monastery-organized Tibetan language and cultural classes have been shut down. 

The monastery school was seen as a place to study and learn Tibetan language…and there were many parents sending their children to monastery school during the school vacation, but the number [of students] is smaller now.…The best hope now is the parents. Parents can teach their children the Tibetan language because there is no other way now. 
</QuotePrimary>

In addition to preventing access to extracurricular language classes, Chinese authorities are engaged in an intense campaign to break Tibetan children’s adherence to their Buddhist faith, an essential part of Tibetan culture and sense of identity. One person describes:

<QuotePrimary>
Nowadays, students are not allowed to engage in any religious activities and must not visit monasteries and temples. We Tibetans visit monasteries and temples during any auspicious Buddhist days, however, the students are prohibited. If any student is found visiting monasteries and temples, they could face severe punishment.
</QuotePrimary>

One former student described how this was enacted at her school:
<QuotePrimary>
On some weekends, students are not allowed to go home. For example, during big religious festivals or sensitive times like March 10th [Tibetan Uprising Day] or big Tibetan religious days, [the school] always has class over the weekend because they don’t want the children to attend family functions or religious holidays. In this way, they keep the children from learning culture at these big family gatherings. And then when it is a Chinese cultural holiday, they do give a holiday, but you have to make up for that day off [by attending school] on a weekend.
</QuotePrimary>

This policy aims to further widen the chasm between Tibetan children and their parents by prohibiting parents from passing on their own religious beliefs and traditions to their children. Parents who try to do so are characterized as undermining their children’s own best interests and wellbeing. 

In Yushul, parents received a letter in September 2023 explaining to them that “Educating minors not to believe in religion is an obligation for both schools and parents….No organization or individual shall persuade or induce students to believe in religion, let alone engage in any activities that would lead to the presence of believers in schools.” The letter continues to lay out the Party view of religion:

<QuotePrimary>
Preventing minors from believing in religion is a guarantee for children to grow up healthily and achieve a better future….Minors are very vulnerable to religion and even to illegal religious activities. The influence of extremist thoughts affects their physical and mental health and future.

Both religious and non-religious parents should educate their children not to enter places of religious activities, not to participate in religious activities, not to participate in religious training courses and summer camps.

</QuotePrimary>

The letter concludes by explicitly linking non-religiosity to China’s stability, appealing to parents to “build the Great Wall to resist and prevent religious infiltration into the school, maintain the harmony and stability of the school, and help it make its due contribution to the long-term stability of the motherland.”


# Boarding Close to Home

Some parents are required to board their children even if the school is nearby. This contradicts the primary justification given by the Chinese government for the existence of the boarding system: ostensibly, providing high-quality education to a small, rural population spread over a large area with poor roads.

A Tibetan family in Lhasa explained that children now have to board at schools in “Education City,” a massive boarding school complex a 20-minute drive away. A recent change – believed to be a consequence of international criticism of the boarding schools – in theory modifies this so that children can go home at night. However, because attendance is still mandatory from 7:30am to 9:30pm, it is impractical to bring the children home. “None of the parents think this is good because children won’t get enough sleep,” so in practice, the children are still boarding.

The requirement to board even when children live near the school is also evidenced by recent coverage in The Economist, from a journalist who was able to make a rare trip to Tibet. He discovered that, despite Chinese officials’ insistence that the boarding schools exist to spare Tibetan farmers’ and herders’ children “long and arduous journeys to school,” even students who were local to the area were boarding. Notably, this requirement for locals to board only applied to Tibetan children, not Hui (Chinese Muslim) children. The journalist was told that “rules are different for Tibetan pupils.”

Another account describes how local preschools were being closed and children required to board at a central preschool, even if they lived nearby:

<QuotePrimary>
In the last two to three years, at least nine of the village preschools in [location name removed] were closed down and [parents were] asked to send all their children to the township’s boarding school. Even though the boarding school is not that far away, the parents were not given any choice whether they wanted to have their children board or not. People suspect that the township authorities are under pressure and have to meet a certain target of children going to preschool boarding.

</QuotePrimary>
A 2023 paper by Chinese geographers provides further evidence that politics, not access to education, fuels the drive for Tibetan children to live in boarding school rather than at home. The study shows that the vast majority of Tibetan elementary-school children in the TAR could travel to school daily in a relatively short amount of time: 70% of the population live less than 30 minutes from an elementary school, and 87% live within an hour.

Instead, from preschool through high school, from Lhasa to Rebkong to Ngaba, the Chinese government is expending massive resources to ensure that Tibetan children are living in boarding schools, separated from their families, and exposed only to ideas and practices sanctioned by the Party.
