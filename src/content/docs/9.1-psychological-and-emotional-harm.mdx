The policies of removing children from their family and community as early as age three, preventing them from speaking their mother tongue, and indoctrinating them to see themselves as Chinese are causing psychological harm to Tibetan children as individuals, and reshaping Tibetan society in accordance with the Chinese government’s designs.

Upon attending colonial boarding school/preschool, children suffer both the trauma of separation from their families and that of being suddenly transplanted into a new language and culture. A former boarding school student now living in exile recalled:

<QuotePrimary>
I remember the first few days were difficult. I missed my family and I could not cry [because of the trauma]. I could not communicate with other students and teachers because I didn't know Chinese then. There were many other children who missed their family and cried. Some younger children, in the middle of the night, would often wake up crying and run to the school gate.

She added:

We have summer and winter school breaks and we also have a 5 day holiday on National Day of the People's Republic of China, Oct 1, but I don't go home for the 5 day holiday. My village is a day ride in a car. Because I don't see my family very often, the most difficult or challenging part was living away from family and missing them….At school, I was part of a group of around 20 students. We were a group of students who didn't go home often and didn't have much family contact.

She later explained how this affected her psychologically:
<QuotePrimary>
[Boarding schools in Tibet are] a massive project of the Chinese government. As I was very young and did not understand Chinese, I was scared of speaking to teachers and also students. I missed my parents every day. Later I even lost the courage to speak to anyone or go to any place where there are people. I really did not learn much during my days in boarding school. I was sad and lost.
