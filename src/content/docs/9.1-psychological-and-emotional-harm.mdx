The policies of removing children from their family and community as early as age three, preventing them from speaking their mother tongue, and indoctrinating them to see themselves as Chinese are causing psychological harm to Tibetan children as individuals, and reshaping Tibetan society in accordance with the Chinese government’s designs.

Upon attending colonial boarding school/preschool, children suffer both the trauma of separation from their families and that of being suddenly transplanted into a new language and culture. A former boarding school student now living in exile recalled:

<QuotePrimary>
I remember the first few days were difficult. I missed my family and I could not cry [because of the trauma]. I could not communicate with other students and teachers because I didn't know Chinese then. There were many other children who missed their family and cried. Some younger children, in the middle of the night, would often wake up crying and run to the school gate.

She added:
<QuotePrimary>
We have summer and winter school breaks and we also have a 5 day holiday on National Day of the People's Republic of China, Oct 1, but I don't go home for the 5 day holiday. My village is a day ride in a car. Because I don't see my family very often, the most difficult or challenging part was living away from family and missing them….At school, I was part of a group of around 20 students. We were a group of students who didn't go home often and didn't have much family contact.
</QuotePrimary>

She later explained how this affected her psychologically:
<QuotePrimary>
[Boarding schools in Tibet are] a massive project of the Chinese government. As I was very young and did not understand Chinese, I was scared of speaking to teachers and also students. I missed my parents every day. Later I even lost the courage to speak to anyone or go to any place where there are people. I really did not learn much during my days in boarding school. I was sad and lost.
</QuotePrimary>

Other former students agreed, saying that being separated from family and not being able to go home was the most difficult aspect of colonial boarding school. One said, “Sometimes, I felt like a prisoner in the school.” 

At its worst, forced attendance at colonial boarding school has resulted in children taking their own lives. For example, earlier this year, RFA reported that a 17-year-old monk who had been made to attend colonial boarding school had committed suicide. Their sources described how the boy, Longyang, was removed from his monastery at age 14. Not allowed to return to the monastery even during school breaks, Longyang would periodically become depressed, stop eating, become ill, and be sent home to his family. Although initially authorities allowed him and other young monks to wear their monks’ robes at school on certain occasions, and not to be present at school at all times, restrictions tightened in early 2024, when Longyang and others were told they had to disrobe and stay permanently at school. One of the sources said, “He had said that if he would be permanently stripped of his robes and required to go to school in his plainclothes, then he would kill himself.” He again became depressed and, when sent home, took his own life.

## Emotional Distance from Family

Separation from family and community is not limited to physical distance. Tibetans describe how their children, immersed in Chinese language and culture and barred from their own mother tongue, lose their ability to communicate with their families. While the loss of language alone is something that will impact a child’s life forever, being unable to communicate with family members, especially grandparents, means children are also cut off from the transfer of knowledge, history, and culture between generations. One Tibetan explains:

<QuotePrimary>
Children [who go to boarding school] now cannot speak in Tibetan with their families. Children from a very young age learn Chinese and start speaking in a mix of Tibetan and Chinese making the conversation with their parents difficult to understand.
</QuotePrimary>

Another echoed these concerns, saying:
<QuotePrimary>
For a nation, language and culture are the most important and the Chinese government is trying to eradicate it by teaching Chinese language to young children and creating a gap between the parent and children to learn the language and Tibetan way of life, culture and tradition. 
</QuotePrimary>

This destruction of Tibetan language ability and roots in Tibetan culture alienates children from their heritage, altering how they see themselves in the world. This manifests in various ways: Children can no longer identify the different kinds of Tibetan livestock such as horses or yaks. One person who went to boarding school even before Xi Jinping brought in extreme measures of all-Chinese teaching and indoctrination recalled feeling like he had “lost touch” with everyday household chores like saddling a horse or lighting a kitchen fire. He was even scared of animals like yaks, thinking they would attack him. 

Children’s social-emotional connection to their families and community is also damaged. A Tibetan recently escaped to India described how he sees colonial boarding school impacting his own family:

<QuotePrimary>
…When these children [who attend boarding school] return home, they cannot speak in Tibetan with their family members. They only communicate in Chinese and it becomes difficult at home. The government aims to change these Tibetan children to Chinese by removing Tibetan identity.
</QuotePrimary>

He continued:
<QuotePrimary>
[My] niece who goes to boarding school likes to stay alone at home when she comes home for vacation. She doesn't like to communicate with other family members. Tibetan children who study in Chinese boarding schools develop cultural and communication gaps with their grandparents and parents as the [grandparents and parents] do not understand Chinese.
</QuotePrimary>

Another described:
<QuotePrimary>
[M]y nephews and nieces…only speak in Chinese. When they get back home after school, they cannot really do any household chores. The children have become ungrateful – arrogant in a sense – and the parents think it's better not to send the children if they are only learning this at school. 
</QuotePrimary>

A handful of Tibetan and Chinese academic papers document the negative social, emotional and psychological impact of boarding school life on Tibetans, as well as other non-Chinese children. For example, one 2020 study by Chinese academics on boarding elementary schools in “ethnic areas” of China found the schools often failed to adequately protect students’ physical and mental health, particularly for young students. They found that, due to the absence of parental care, boarding students often felt helpless and extremely lonely. Teachers and dormitory administrators described that younger students often cried at night for their parents, and every year, the new students would cry for several days before calming down. Additionally, many students experienced  frequent bullying and the threat of school bullying caused significant psychological distress and fear.

A 2021 study on the mental health status of 3,500 Tibetan middle school students living in colonial boarding schools in two areas of Ü-Tsang (Chinese: TAR) concluded that “psychological problems among Tibetan middle school students [are] relatively high. Among them, nostalgia, study pressure, psychological irritability, loneliness, interpersonal tension, and inferiority are the most prominent.” The same study also highlighted the unique challenges faced by Tibetan girls  going through puberty away from home, describing their mental health as “extremely unstable.”

The disturbing impacts of boarding school life on Tibetan children have been identified for more than a decade. As cited in Tibet Action Institute’s first report, a 2016 paper found that more than one in three Tibetan students from Grade 7-12 at two schools in Amdo (Chinese: Qinghai) were experiencing high levels of alienation – described as a deep sense of anguish or loss, as well as an inability to connect meaningfully with others. Academic research was cited showing that behavioral issues, substance abuse, and suicide are associated with high levels of alienation. Additionally, a 2014 study by two other researchers found varying degrees of mental health problems among Tibetan boarding school students, including apathy, anxiety, and interaction disorders.

Another 2016 paper warned that without an emotional outlet, students will face “anxiety, irritability, mood swings, and, in severe cases, depression” and some will become withdrawn. The study continued: “More concerning is that some students develop feelings of despair, with some even having suicidal thoughts." 

These studies corroborate the enormous psychological and emotional harm that Tibetans describe observing in those who attend colonial boarding schools. Feelings of loss and homesickness combine with the deliberate reshaping of identity through state-approved Chinese culture, practices, and language, to gradually alienate children from their families and communities and alter their sense of who they are. Over time, this creates a permanent distance and irreversible estrangement between children and their own families. It also changes the children’s relationship to their larger community and to Tibetans as a people, breaking social cohesion and dismantling norms and institutions that have held Tibetans together for centuries.
