## China
1. Halt the coerced removal of children from monasteries and homes and into state boarding schools.
2. Impose a moratorium on further construction of boarding schools and preschools.
3. Drop charges and release from prison all Tibetans who have been incarcerated because of advocating for use and preservation of Tibetan language, including in schools.
4. Abolish the boarding school system imposed on Tibetan children, halt the closure of Tibetan village and monastic schools, and allow private Tibetan schools to reopen.
5. Reverse the deceptively-named “bilingual education” policy that replaces Tibetan with Chinese as the medium of instruction and allow a Tibetan-language curriculum developed by Tibetans that responds to the needs of Tibetans rather than being centered on Chinese identity, history and culture.
6. Stop firing Tibetan teachers and instead, hire and train more Tibetan teachers in Tibetan areas, especially in rural communities, and halt their displacement by Chinese teachers, to ensure that Tibetan students have access to high quality education in the Tibetan language and in their home communities, without being separated from their families.
7. Permit immediate and unfettered access to independent UN monitors to conduct an investigation into the alleged abuse, neglect, deaths, and mental health concerns within Tibetan boarding schools, with full access to school facilities, staff, students and their parents.


## Other Governments
1. Call for the immediate abolition of the colonial boarding school system in all meetings with Chinese government representatives, including during visits by Chinese leaders, visits to the People’s Republic of China, and high-level meetings of intergovernmental fora, as recommended by UN Special Procedures, UN Committee on the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
2. Enact economic sanctions and visa restrictions on authorities at schools where physical abuse or negligence is known to be taking place and on intellectuals and officials responsible for developing and implementing educational policies in Tibet that violate Tibetans’ human rights. These policies include the colonial boarding school and preschool system in Tibet, elimination of Tibetan-medium teaching, closures of Tibetan-run private schools and vacation classes, and forced transfer of children from monastic schools to state-run boarding schools.
3. Member states on the Human Rights Council should, acknowledging the scope and severity of violations related to boarding schools in Tibet, especially in light of the urgent risks they pose to children, support a special session on China in 2025.
4. Underwrite educational programs that support promotion and preservation of Tibetan language and culture, including Tibetan-run weekend-schools, language and culture vacation camps, and intensive Tibetan language immersion programs; development of Tibetan-medium curriculum; and higher education opportunities for Tibetan students, teachers, and scholars, especially those from Tibet.
5. Provide financial resources to support Tibetan language training through public institutions and to diplomats.

## United Nations
1. The Human Rights Council, acknowledging the scope and severity of violations related to boarding schools in Tibet, especially in light of the urgent risks they pose to children, should convene a special session on China in 2025.
2. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, in coordination with the Special Procedures and CRC, CEDAW, and CERD experts who have already expressed concerns about colonial boarding schools in Tibet, should announce an initiative to gather information about all CBS to carry out an investigation and push for standing invitations for Special Procedures to visit. 
3. Special Procedures should urgently issue a communication to the Chinese authorities, expressing serious concern over the forced separation of Tibetan children from their families and reports of the severe psychological harm resulting from this policy.
