In interviews and conversations with Tibetans either still in Tibet or recently arrived in exile, Tibetans repeatedly described parents as having “no choice,” being “forced” to send their children to boarding school and, if they disobey or refuse, being “harassed,” “threatened,” and “punished.” Parents have been threatened with beatings and government officials have been warned they would lose their jobs if they do not enroll their children in boarding school. One person described that in the case of parents who are elderly, “police often take [other family members] and make them work as a part of punishment.” Various financial benefits from the government can also be withheld, such as in this area of Kardze prefecture (Chinese: Ganzi):

After Grade 1, the children have to stay in boarding school, which is about 60-70 miles away. The children are allowed to come home once a week or every two weeks…If the nomads don't send their children to school, the government does not pay them [a subsidy they usually receive].

One parent described how families of young monks and nuns from Muge Monastery were visited repeatedly by authorities, who “came multiple times a day, knocking on our doors, insisting we send our children to school.” All family members received messages about the importance of education, and they were warned that not sending children to boarding school would be illegal. They were assured that their children would have excellent care, including medical care and leave whenever parents requested it. They were also told that parents could choose the school their child attended. These commitments were all broken.The parent stated, “When they came to take our children, it felt as if they were searching for prisoners we were hiding. They tried every method to take our children from us.”

The tactic of “thought work” – a term for persistent visits by authorities to, in turn, persuade and threaten until the people being targeted comply – is also used in other cases involving coercive removal of children into colonial boarding schools. In a recent article in The China Quarterly, Yonten Nyima and Emily Yeh describe how the government moves Tibetan nomads’ children to faraway boarding schools to “convince” their parents to leave behind their lives in the grasslands and resettle in urban centers. They detail the case of a Tibetan family reluctant to be resettled, whose children the government moves from a boarding school about 25 miles from the family’s land to one located about 370 miles away. As a result of this impossible distance from their children and other “thought work,” the family eventually agrees to move to the resettlement area closer to the new school. 

Two sources described similar situations where families moved from rural areas to urban areas to stay closer to their children in boarding school. In this way, the Chinese government accomplishes not only the objective of removing children from their family and culture and into the custody of the state but also eliminating Tibetans’ traditional livelihoods, lifestyles, and social structures. Both projects serve to reforge future generations of Tibetans in a new Chinese image.
