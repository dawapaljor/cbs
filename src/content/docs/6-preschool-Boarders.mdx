Tibet Action Institute’s previous report focused on primary and secondary school children forced to attend boarding schools, but there is increasing evidence that even younger children are being compelled to do so across Tibet. For most rural families, this means children leave their homes at ages three, four, or five to live in Chinese government-run institutions. Children of urban families are also required to attend Chinese-language preschool, but to Tibet Action Institute’s knowledge, these children do not yet have to board. One Tibetan described how children in their area are now required to enroll in preschool:

<IndentText>
    Earlier, you had a choice to send your children to preschool but now it's compulsory, you have to send them to preschool. If you do not send your child to the preschool, then you cannot enroll them for [grade] school because the school requires you to show a preschool certificate. You cannot send the children any later to preschool, because then they are too old.

Someone from Ü-Tsang who recently arrived in exile explained:
<IndentText>
Most of the school facilities are available in township, county, or bigger cities. The government orders all children from age three to go to preschool and many people…who live in villages send their children to township schools. The children from rural areas stay in these preschools. In preschool, there are three grade levels. Only after a child completes preschool would they be promoted to grade one.

Tibetans also describe threats from the government if they do not send their children to preschool. For example, one person described nomads being told to send their children 20-40 kilometers away (13-25 miles) and facing harassment if they did not.

The establishment of boarding preschools is reflected in comments from Tibetans across Tibet. Specifically, we have documented reports of preschool boarding in rural areas of Ü-Tsang (TAR); Rebkong (Chinese: Tongren), Tsojang (Chinese: Haibei) and Golok (Chinese: Guoluo) prefectures in Qinghai; Kanlho (Chinese: Gannan) prefecture in Gansu; and Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) prefecture in Sichuan. From our research, it appears that boarding preschools are usually housed in or attached to township-level elementary boarding schools.

Information about the number of children enrolled is extremely difficult to find. However, information obtained for just seven counties of two Tibetan prefectures (Kanlho and Ngaba) in eastern Tibet shows that almost 9,000 preschool children are boarding in dozens of preschools. The enrollment in each preschool ranges from a few dozen to hundreds of children. Gyal Lo, an educational sociologist who escaped from Tibet in 2021 visited more than 50 boarding preschools in Amdo and Kham (now part of Qinghai, Sichuan, and Gansu). Based on this and other research, he estimates at least 100,000 Tibetan children ages 4-6 are living in these institutions across Tibet today.

Outside Tibet, in China’s wealthy cities, boarding preschool became popular in the 1990s. But as the psychological toll became clearer, it fell out of fashion. Despite the known psychological harm preschool boarding causes – even when attendance is voluntary – the Chinese government is building an extensive preschool boarding system in Tibet. And there, boarding preschool is not a choice.

Requiring preschoolers to leave their homes and families traumatizes both the children and their family members. A Tibetan from Tibet who now lives abroad told the BBC the story of her relative in Tibet leaving his son, just turned five, in boarding school for the first time:

<IndentText>
A close relative told me it had been hard for him to leave his son at boarding school, so he made a plan. He told the teacher: ‘When I drop him off I’ll have a short conversation with him and then I’ll leave. I’ll tell my son that I need to step out briefly. You need to tell him ‘your father will come back soon’. And then, no matter how hard he cries, you lock the door when I walk away. Don’t open it until I am out of sight or he’ll try to escape from the classroom and come after me.’ My relative told me that he could hear his son crying crazily.

A Tibetan still inside Tibet described a friend of theirs who faced a similar situation where their young child had to be “locked up” in a room so the parent could leave the child at boarding school. They said, “Keeping children as young as 5-6 years old [at boarding school] is unimaginable. It's totally wrong.”

In this heartbreaking situation, parents try to provide what comfort they can to their loved ones. In one area, after dropping their children off for boarding preschool, some parents live out of their cars for the rest of the week to be nearby. Sometimes one family from the community stays near the school to take care of all the children from the village, while the other families take care of that family’s work.

Contact with family can be extremely limited. At best, children return to their families on the weekends. One person described how children in her county are sent to boarding preschools in other counties, rather than their own, and parents are only allowed to visit every three months. Another explained that at the preschool where her friend’s child is, parents are allowed to bring children home on weekends, but because it is so far away, many children stay at school on the weekends regardless.

This experience estranges these young children from their families and their culture. One Tibetan described the boarding preschools she knew:

<IndentText>
In these preschools, the teachers communicate with children in Chinese, they teach children to sing political songs in praise of the communist heroes like Mao, or the CCP and New China. Although there is a Tibetan [language] class, it is very poor. Most of these children speak only in Chinese, there are very few children who speak in Tibetan. At home, these children communicate with their family members in Chinese and have adopted Chinese customs and have forgotten about their Tibetan customs.

The schools also alienate children from their families, and lead to psychological harm. Gyal Lo has shared his personal story of the effects of boarding preschool on his grand-nieces. At ages four and five, they almost immediately began to lose their facility with Tibetan, choosing instead to speak Chinese – the language in which they were immersed for most of their waking hours. Even more distressing, they lost their connection to their family, keeping themselves physically apart when at home, choosing not to speak or engage with family members except in a limited way, and remaining emotionally distant.

Alienation and psychological harm has been documented in studies of older Tibetan children in boarding school, as reported in our previous report. Additional such evidence is presented in a later section of this report.

Removing children from their families and immersing them in a language other than their mother tongue at an extremely young age is almost diametrically opposed to best practices established by international experts, as well as to international law.
