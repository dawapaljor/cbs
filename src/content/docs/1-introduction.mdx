In June 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping walked through a boarding school for Tibetan middle-schoolers, smiling, “inspecting,” and greeting students. The children came from Golok, roughly 300 miles away, and a state media article praised this school as having helped alleviate a shortage in a poor, rural Tibetan area. But just two weeks later, Chinese authorities forced the closure of a famed Tibetan private school in Golok – the same area from which the boarding school students came. Located in a rural part of the prefecture, this private school had served thousands of Tibetan students over decades, providing a high-quality education with both a contemporary curriculum and traditional Tibetan subjects, as well as Tibetan, Chinese, and English classes.

Xi’s visit and the accompanying closure of one of Tibet’s premier educational institutions illustrate an existential struggle underway in Tibet. Tibetans have tenaciously maintained their culture, religion, language, and national cohesion over more than 70 years of occupation by China, despite extreme levels of repression. The Chinese government – and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that controls it – perceives this resilience and separate identity as a threat to its control. Having failed to eradicate it through oppressive surveillance, repression, and punishment, the Chinese government is now trying to do so through Tibetan children. The strategy: identity erasure through assimilationist boarding schools. 

This report provides new and updated information about China’s colonial boarding school system in Tibet, drawn primarily from interviews and conversations with Tibetans either recently escaped to exile in India or still living in Tibet. It follows Tibet Action Institute’s December 2021 report that revealed that approximately 800,000-900,000 Tibetan children ages 6-18 were living in a vast system of Chinese government-run colonial boarding schools, and subsequent estimates by a Tibetan educational sociologist that at least 100,000 children ages 4-6 are in boarding preschools. 


Over the past three years, Chinese authorities have continued to expand preschool and grade school boarding and forcibly transferred more monks and nuns under 18 to state boarding schools. Accordingly, we believe that the higher end of the range of children boarding given in the original report is more accurate. Thus, we estimate that at least one million Tibetan children are now living in state-run boarding institutions. We call on the Chinese government to openly publish the number of Tibetan children in boarding schools, including preschools.

These children are separated from their parents and communities for the majority of their childhoods, while also being subjected to a curriculum that is taught in the Chinese language, focused on Chinese history, culture, and identity, and that includes heavy political indoctrination. Xi Jinping has made politicized and propagandistic education a priority throughout China in the last decade, but in Tibet, occupied by China since 1949-50, it serves a colonial purpose of altering Tibetan children’s identity and worldview.
