In June 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping walked through a boarding school for Tibetan middle-schoolers, smiling, “inspecting,” and greeting students. The children came from Golok, roughly 300 miles away, and a state media article praised this school as having helped alleviate a shortage in a poor, rural Tibetan area. But just two weeks later, Chinese authorities forced the closure of a famed Tibetan private school in Golok – the same area from which the boarding school students came. Located in a rural part of the prefecture, this private school had served thousands of Tibetan students over decades, providing a high-quality education with both a contemporary curriculum and traditional Tibetan subjects, as well as Tibetan, Chinese, and English classes.

Xi’s visit and the accompanying closure of one of Tibet’s premier educational institutions illustrate an existential struggle underway in Tibet. Tibetans have tenaciously maintained their culture, religion, language, and national cohesion over more than 70 years of occupation by China, despite extreme levels of repression. The Chinese government – and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that controls it – perceives this resilience and separate identity as a threat to its control. Having failed to eradicate it through oppressive surveillance, repression, and punishment, the Chinese government is now trying to do so through Tibetan children. The strategy: identity erasure through assimilationist boarding schools. 

This report provides new and updated information about China’s colonial boarding school system in Tibet, drawn primarily from interviews and conversations with Tibetans either recently escaped to exile in India or still living in Tibet. It follows Tibet Action Institute’s December 2021 report that revealed that approximately 800,000-900,000 Tibetan children ages 6-18 were living in a vast system of Chinese government-run colonial boarding schools, and subsequent estimates by a Tibetan educational sociologist that at least 100,000 children ages 4-6 are in boarding preschools. 

Over the past three years, Chinese authorities have continued to expand preschool and grade school boarding and forcibly transferred more monks and nuns under 18 to state boarding schools. Accordingly, we believe that the higher end of the range of children boarding given in the original report is more accurate. Thus, we estimate that at least one million Tibetan children are now living in state-run boarding institutions. We call on the Chinese government to openly publish the number of Tibetan children in boarding schools, including preschools.

These children are separated from their parents and communities for the majority of their childhoods, while also being subjected to a curriculum that is taught in the Chinese language, focused on Chinese history, culture, and identity, and that includes heavy political indoctrination. Xi Jinping has made politicized and propagandistic education a priority throughout China in the last decade, but in Tibet, occupied by China since 1949-50, it serves a colonial purpose of altering Tibetan children’s identity and worldview.

Parents have no other option but to send their children to boarding school. As one person described:

<QuotePrimary>
    …Some people do not want to send their children to boarding school but they don't have any other choice. Parents do not want their children to be illiterate, so with that hope, they send their children to the schools. But when these children return home, they cannot speak in Tibetan with their family members. They only communicate in Chinese and it becomes difficult at home. The government aims to change these Tibetan children to Chinese by removing Tibetan identity.
</QuotePrimary>


Tibet Action Institute has found new evidence that, in order to cement this transformation of identity and allegiance, the Chinese government now even attempts to control what children are exposed to during school breaks or other visits home, banning students from attending Tibetan language classes during school vacation and forbidding parents from involving their children in religious activities. Tibetan children’s lives are being irrevocably altered to serve the purposes of the Chinese government. This is being done in blatant violation of domestic and international law and contrary to best practices that have been flagged to the Chinese government for decades by UN bodies such as the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Committee on the Rights of the Child, Special Procedures, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Decision makers, international institutions, and journalists around the world have taken note of the Chinese government’s systematic effort to wipe out Tibetan identity through coercive boarding schools and have responded by raising the alarm about these insidious human rights violations being committed on a mass scale. The Chinese government, in turn, has launched a propaganda campaign which vociferously and aggressively attacks any critique of the colonial boarding school system as politically motivated and describes the boarding schools as a benevolent means to bring free, high-quality education to a population that lives in areas so remote that – according to officials – accessing education locally is not possible or practical.

The evidence in this report refutes Chinese government claims about the schools. Instead, it illustrates the harsh realities of the colonial boarding school system, namely:

<List list="list-disc">
        <li>Children are highly vulnerable to negligence and abuse in these schools;</li>
        <li>Boarding can start when children are as young as three or four years old in rural areas;</li>
        <li>Tibetan children spend the majority of their childhoods in the custody of the Chinese state rather than that of their families;</li>
        <li>Parents have no choice but to send their children to state boarding schools;</li>
        <li>The schools are fragmenting Tibetan families, Tibetan identity, and the very fabric of Tibetan society;</li>
        <li>The system is a colonial attempt by the Chinese government to alter the minds and reorient the loyalties of Tibetans as a people, in order to eliminate the basis of Tibetan group identity and collective action; and</li>
        <li>Tibetans are resisting as they can while living under extreme repression.</li>
</List>
The report first explains where and what Tibet is, and then presents new evidence of neglect and abuse within the boarding system and of children aged three to six from rural areas living in boarding preschools. It examines Chinese government efforts to ensure that Tibetan children “will study in a school, live in a school, and grow up in a school” and how parents are coerced into relinquishing their children into the colonial boarding system. It looks at the devastating impacts of colonial boarding schools in both the short and long term, and how they are fulfilling the Chinese government’s apparent intention to destroy Tibetans’ national identity. Finally, it presents examples of how Tibetans are resisting policies related to the colonial boarding schools, and makes recommendations for governments.
