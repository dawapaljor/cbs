Since our first report on China’s colonial boarding schools in Tibet was published in December 2021, numerous cases of abuse and negligence have emerged. While China’s propaganda videos depict happy children on boarding school campuses and tout the safety and care provided to students there, independent accounts from Tibet paint a very different picture: one where Tibetan children face mistreatment – ranging from poor nutrition to severe abuse and negligence. Their families have no redress and in some cases are physically prevented from seeing their children, even for health and safety reasons.

Many Tibetan sources expressed concern about the poor quality of the food provided to students, explaining that it poses a health risk and causes health problems. One parent described that although children must go to boarding school after grade one, “the food is so poor that the children don't want to go to school.” Several people noted that the food was old or of low quality, but also that there was not enough to feed everyone. One suspected that the death of their relative in boarding school was related to health issues connected to the bad food (we are unable to independently corroborate this due to the sensitivity of communication about these issues). In one case brought to Tibet Action Institute’s attention, a senior employee at one school was interrogated by authorities because of raising concerns about food quality in boarding schools.

Beyond problems with the food quality, accounts by parents, teachers, and students indicate that beatings are a regular part of boarding school life. A former student now in exile explained that their dormitories were checked while they were in class, and “if [school authorities] found that we had not kept it clean, we were beaten as a punishment.” One interviewee believed that teachers are aware that it is against the law to beat students, but they still do. Another Tibetan described teachers deliberately taking students outside areas monitored by CCTV in order to beat them. There are also cases of students bullying or physically assaulting each other, with no protection or intervention from the school.

Two Tibetans explained how at the school in their area, which has both day students from nearby and boarding students from other areas, religious symbols or practice are met with physical punishment:

<QuotePrimary>
Students are restricted from wearing any religious/prayer threads around their necks and wrists and chanting Tibetan prayers. If the students are found chanting prayers and wearing any religious/prayer threads, they are beaten by the teacher.
</QuotePrimary>

Physical abuse at boarding school can be extreme. A Tibetan who recently arrived in exile described how in his area of eastern Tibet, Tibetan teachers mostly stopped beating children after a respected local figure drew attention to it. “However, Chinese teachers really beat the children badly, they kick and punch anywhere. I have seen children with bruises on their bodies, who have suffered fractures, and sometimes the beatings were so bad that they had problems sitting.” A parent reported that her middle-school aged daughter returned home for school break with one area of her body covered in bruises, having been beaten by a teacher.

Another Tibetan described how this physical abuse is endemic, and parents are unable to intervene:


<QuotePrimary>
I [work] in a boarding school, and so I know that most teachers take out their stress on students. If they don’t do their job right and are reprimanded, they take it out on their students. Students are almost treated like birds in a cage, and parents do not have a way to intervene effectively. I know of many examples of teachers beating children, and also of bullying in school.

Parents are rarely able to protect their children, and they or their children are even threatened if they attempt to do so. Several Tibetans still inside Tibet described how parents seeking to raise concerns are intimidated into silence. For example, one parent described how a teacher called the police on them after they confronted the teacher about their child being beaten. The parent stated that schools often call the police to intervene with parents, and the police “always take their side.” Parents are afraid that their children will suffer if they complain. The parent concluded, “there is a systemic problem.”

One interviewee identified nomads as an especially vulnerable group – both students, who are singled out, and parents, who are often unaware of what is happening to their children:

<QuotePrimary>
The nomad children living in boarding schools suffer a lot. Those who cook and clean are Chinese or Hui Muslims and they humiliate and insult nomad children for their background. There were several cases of children losing their ability to hear after being slapped on the ears by Chinese staff.

[In my county] cases of corporal punishment in Tibetan boarding schools are normal, since nomads do not make any formal complaints as either they are unaware or they are far away from the boarding school.

When I was in Grade 3 or 4, a Grade 5 or 6 student committed suicide by jumping off the fifth floor of the school building. Nomad kids are more honest and straightforward, but these traits are often looked down upon and humiliated in the school. A teacher beat up the child, and he later jumped off the school building and died.

The school authorities prevent such stories from getting out and nomadic families often don't get compensation for their childrens’ injuries or lives.

In recent months, exceptionally rare video evidence of Tibetan children alleging abuse and even being abused has been sent to Tibetans outside of Tibet or posted on Chinese social media. In November 2024, a video emerged of a Tibetan boy being beaten by the school’s Chinese principal on the playground at Tsokhyil Township Ethnic Boarding Primary School (Chinese: Quanji Township National Boarding Primary School) in Kangtsa County in the Tso Ngon region of Tibet’s Amdo province (Chinese: Gangcha County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai). The principal, identified as the local Communist Party Secretary Dang Qingfu (Chinese: 党青福), was filmed while classmates and teachers looked on. The video was shared with the school’s parents' association and went viral online, but Tibetans were later barred from sharing it. Despite claims of an investigation, the principal remained in his position. 

A video recorded from CCTV footage at a boarding elementary school in October 2021 showed a teacher violently beating a child in front of other students, including with a chair. The school where the incident occurred is the Chamdo No. 1 Elementary School in Chamdo (Chinese: Qamdo) in the eastern Tibetan province of Kham (Chinese: Tibet Autonomous Region). According to the New York Times, “The video circulated on the internet in China more than 1,000 times before it was taken down. The school at which the beating took place has been described in state media reports as having students who lived on campus. The video set off a public outcry. In response, the local government conducted an investigation and said in an official statement that the beating had left a three-inch-long wound on the child’s forehead and that the teacher had been suspended.”

These accounts from Tibetans illustrate an environment characterized by negligence, lack of care, and abuse – both routine and targeted. The two case studies below provide in-depth examples of how extreme this can be, and the brutal impacts it has on the lives of children and their families.

Young monks and nuns appear to be singled out for particularly egregious mistreatment because of their religious background. In one area of Ngaba, eastern Tibet, a group of five young monks reportedly tried to take their own lives in September 2024 after being forcibly removed from their monastery school and transferred to a state-run boarding school. In an emotional video taken after the five children were stopped from jumping into a river, one child cries out, “It’s unbearable to stay in the school, which is like a prison!” Another agrees, saying, “They don’t give us good food and [they] beat us.” Later one says, “We’re discriminated against. Unlike other students [in the school] we’re not taught the regular curriculum and are beaten and harassed and even denied water to drink.” Another adds, “It’s true, we’re intentionally denied even water to drink with our medicine when we’re unwell.

   …[In June, authorities] took the monks from the monastery and kept them in [a local primary school]. They completely sealed the gate and [the young monks] were not allowed to meet anybody. Many parents begged and cried at the gate, so some of them were [eventually] allowed to meet….For the last two months [the young monks] have been taught military training, praise songs to the Party, exercises, Party thought, etc. They were not given a single day’s holiday. They are treated more like prisoners than like regular students.…Parents were crying to see how they were treating our children.

    After [being taken on a] tour to China, [the children] didn’t want to return [to the boarding school] but authorities kept threatening the imprisonment of their parents. They again forcefully put them on the bus and took them back to that school, and they stopped giving them food and medicine. The monks tried to escape from the prison-like school and ran. Some of them tried to jump in the river, but villagers stopped them. They would all die if they jumped as it’s a big river. Some of them tried to commit suicide as it was becoming unbearable.

Another parent emphasized that authorities had made many promises about the welfare of the children when parents were told they had to attend state boarding school:
    <IndentText>
    When the authorities came to ask us to send our children to school, they never mentioned that they wouldn’t be able to keep them safe. They made many promises about how they would care for the children—they would provide medicine if they got sick, they would ensure they saw a doctor, and if the children were from poor families, they would offer financial support. Now, with children running away, parents have nowhere to file complaints or express their concerns.

The parent continued: 
    <IndentText>
    As parents, it is our duty to protect our children, but as the head of my household, I feel powerless.
