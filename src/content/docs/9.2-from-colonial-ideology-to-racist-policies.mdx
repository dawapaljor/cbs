This ambitious project of wholesale ethnic conversion, aimed at replacing the foundations of Tibetan identity with those of a homogeneous and monolingual Chinese cultural identity, is driven by the colonial ideology of Han supremacy, a topic discussed further in our 2021 report. Government statements, policy directives, propaganda materials, and writings by many Chinese academics betray a deeply ingrained racist worldview that stereotypes Tibetans as ungrateful savages too backward to either seek out or appreciate the blessings of modernization bestowed upon them by China’s civilizing mission.

The assumption of Chinese superiority and Tibetan inferiority undergirds every aspect of the Chinese government’s colonial education system in Tibet. Most obvious is the outright promotion of Chinese language and cultural norms, a process accelerated by the simultaneous demotion of Tibetan language, culture, and religious practice throughout the entire school system. This bias also reveals itself in other circumstances. For example, a Chinese government delegate, when responding to questions before the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR), explained that instruction of Tibetan children had to be in Chinese because the Tibetan language suffers from terminological deficiency in the STEM subjects. 

This criticism is driven by prejudice. A shortage of technical vocabulary is a challenge common to all languages when encountering new subjects. It was not long ago when Mandarin borrowed thousands of loanwords from Japanese and English when China introduced new disciplines like sociology and the natural sciences into its curriculum. All languages have undergone terminological expansion in fields like modern science and technology, and Tibetan is no different. Moreover, the claim that the STEM subjects cannot be taught in Tibetan is particularly cynical in light of the fact that the Chinese government itself publishes a sizable “Chinese-Tibetan-English Dictionary of Science and Technology.” Furthermore, Tibetans in Kham and Amdo taught math, chemistry, biology, and geography in the Tibetan language until around 2020, when authorities began reducing the space for Tibetan as a legitimate medium of instruction and privileging the exclusive use of Chinese. 

The same Chinese government delegate speaking at the UN, displaying the savior complex familiar to classic colonialism, went on to justify the boarding school system. He explained that “due to the plateau situation [in Tibet] the amount of oxygen is comparatively lower. I’ve been to that area to do research and I’ve found the height of the local students is generally lower than the students in other areas. And the people are scattered in different areas. So it is difficult for these students to go to school and it is difficult to guarantee the quality of education.” In sum, because Tibetan children are oxygen deprived, short in stature, and live scattered across the plateau, the authorities must step in and board them at school to ensure they receive a quality education. These attitudes impose a racist framework onto Tibetans and ignore – and worse, destroy – the substantial work done to date by Tibetan academics, teachers, and parents to develop educational solutions that are culturally respectful and locally relevant.

At its core, the Chinese government’s colonial boarding school system represents a chilling reinvention of settler colonialism in the 21st century. These institutions echo the heinous residential schools and other forms of child separation that ravaged Indigenous communities in North America and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries, subjecting them to mass cultural erasure, forced assimilation, and bequeathing to their descendants a legacy of intergenerational trauma. At a time when Western nations have begun to reckon with their genocidal legacies –– in November 2023, President Biden officially apologized for the US government’s role in what he called “a blot on American history,” following the example set by Canada and Australia in showing remorse for their colonial crimes –– China shows no such remorse. On the contrary, Beijing has shown it is interested only in weaponizing the European past to whitewash the Chinese present, and goes to great lengths to exploit North America’s historical crimes to justify its own current atrocities against the Tibetan people. 

Ultimately, China's colonial boarding schooling system seeks to sever Tibetan children en masse from their families, their language, and their heritage, methodically ensuring that the next generation of Tibetans grows up estranged from their own culture. This is not mere historical repetition — it is a calculated, modern-day assault on a people, engineered with the precision of a draconian state that cloaks its colonial ambitions and oppressive policies in the language of “progress" and "development.”
