Research for this report is based on rare firsthand accounts by Tibetans either still in Tibet or who have recently escaped. This includes fifteen interviews conducted between 2023 and 2024 with Tibetans who had recently escaped to India, several statements published online by Tibetans in Tibet, and approximately 70 private or public comments by Tibetans in Tibet from 2022 to January 2025 that were gathered by Tibetans in exile with close contacts in Tibet. We also draw on several academic articles and official statements from the Chinese government.

Discussing China’s colonial boarding schools, its anti-Tibetan language policies, or other colonial policies implemented in Tibet today brings severe risk for Tibetans. Online communication is curtailed by censorship – which limits what information Tibetans can see and who they can talk to – and surveillance, meaning that anything said online is logged, easily searchable using artificial intelligence, and can be used as grounds for punishment. Those in Tibet risk imprisonment or other harsh repercussions. Those in exile face transnational repression and serious threats by the Chinese government against their families still in Tibet.

The Chinese government rarely allows independent researchers or journalists to travel freely to Tibet to investigate the status of the questions discussed in this report. On the rare occasion that a researcher or journalist does make it to Tibet, no Tibetan can speak openly with them about these issues without fear of serious reprisals.

Because of these risks, all names and identifying information of interviewees or online commenters have been removed. Posts by Tibetans inside Tibet have been paraphrased in most cases to reduce their traceability.
