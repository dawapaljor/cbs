The Chinese government has for decades been attempting to diminish and obscure the existence of Tibet and Tibetans. Historical Tibet is composed of the three provinces of Amdo, Kham, and Ü-Tsang. In the 1960s, the Chinese government split Tibet into new administrative divisions: the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and Counties within Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces (see map below).  

As part of its effort to redraw Tibet’s borders, the Chinese government asserts that the Tibet Autonomous Region alone constitutes Tibet. However, this claim is belied by its own map of Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and Counties that make up the majority of the current province of Qinghai, a significant portion of Sichuan, and small parts of Yunnan and Gansu. More than half of Tibetans live outside the TAR, and following the nationwide Tibetan uprising of 2008, the Chinese government’s major policy meetings on Tibet have included all Tibetan areas, not just the TAR. However, Beijing’s public propaganda continues the pretense that Tibet is just a small portion of this area.

The Chinese government engages in significant propaganda to convince its own citizens and the international community that Tibet belongs, and has always belonged, to China. In recent years the Chinese government has tried to normalize its claims to Tibet by using the Chinese word “Xizang” in place of “Tibet,” including starting to refer to the TAR as the “Xizang Autonomous Region.” The Chinese government has been increasing this usage globally as it attempts to reshape the understanding of Tibet as a unique and separate entity.  

These efforts deliberately obfuscate what Tibet is, where Chinese government policies for Tibet are being applied, and who is being impacted by them. For example, answering questions about the high number of Tibetan children in boarding schools at China’s review by the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, a Chinese government official stated that half of students in Tibet (meaning the TAR) were boarding, and “as for the figure one million [children in boarding school or preschool] I don’t know where is this figure from, but I have another figure, in 2020 the Tibetan population was 3.64 million. The minority groups account for 3.2 million.” He explained that accordingly, there could not be one million Tibetan children in boarding school – refusing to acknowledge the existence of all other Tibetans outside the TAR. 

Despite such attempts to propagandize away more than half the Tibetan population in order to dodge criticism, evidence gathered for both this and our 2021 report shows that the colonial boarding system targets all Tibetans and is in place throughout Tibet – Amdo, Kham, and Ü-Tsang.
