			I [work] in a boarding school, and so I know that most teachers take out their stress on students. If they donâ€™t do their job right and are reprimanded, they take it out on their students. Students are almost treated like birds in a cage, and parents do not have a way to intervene effectively. I know of many examples of teachers beating children, and also of bullying in school.
